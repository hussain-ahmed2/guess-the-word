# Guess the Word

A simple game where you have to guess a 5 letter word in 5 attempts.

## How to Play

1. Enter a 5 letter word in the input field.
2. Submit the form.
3. The game will show you a hint about the word.
4. Try to guess the word in 5 attempts.
5. If you guess the word correctly, you win.
6. If you are out of guesses, the game is over.

## How it Works

The game works by selecting a random word from a list of words. The game then compares the input word with the selected word and shows you a hint about the word. The hint is a list of letters that are present in the word and their correct positions. The game also keeps track of the number of guesses you have left.
